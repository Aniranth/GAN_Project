Here are some sample outputs run from bach training. A few notes about the settings.
The seed to produce these samples was "randomly" generated. I did not use a static seed
for the random generator. These samples were all picked randomly. In fact at the time I
had selected these I have not listened to any of the samples. They may be amazing pieces
of art, or they may be comedically bad. I tried to get an even sampling of epoch variety.
The number following output refers to what epoch the piece was created on. This training
cycle was run on an Intel i7-8550U CPU. The graphics card is a non-factor in the algorithm.
Aside from these notes thank you for you interest in my project and enjoy the samples.
