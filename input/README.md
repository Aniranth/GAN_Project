This folder contains all the MIDI files for training. When the program is run every file 
will be taken for training. If you do not want a file to be processed in training change
the file to be a hidden file as you would on Linux. For example:


example.mid # This file will be included in training
.example.mid # This file will be hidden from training


If you have your own MIDI files you would like to test simply put a dot (or delete) all
the MIDI files supplied with this repository and put your own MIDI files into the input
folder.
